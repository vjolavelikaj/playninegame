Play Nine Game with Reactjs

Hey guys, 
To see how this game works , copy and paste the two other files into the https://jscomplete.com/repl/ playground.
It would be respectively app.js > into the main frame and  app.css > into the CSS frame. 
It is not properly finished.
Play around until you get to know how it is properly played.
This game is originally written by Samer Buna at Pluralsight (https://github.com/samerbuna).
There are some dependencies that won't let you deploy it locally , but you could give it a try though.
